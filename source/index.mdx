## Introduction

React List Utilities provides tools to simplify rendering lists with React,
whilst leaving you full control.

I decided to make this library after getting frustrated at existing list
virtualization libraries, believing that there was a better, more modern way
to render these.

**The library is currently in an experimental state and subject to breaking
API changes.**

## Features

- List virtualization

## Installation

```bash
npm install react-list-utilities
# or
yarn add react-list-utilities
```
